# ecommerce-redux

This is an in-progress refactoring of a basic e-commerce website that currently uses the React Context API to deal with State.
Currently being refactored to use the Redux framework to achieve this for scalability. 

With changes to the React Context API being more robust and "built-in" this serves only as an exercise in a convoluted refactoring.
